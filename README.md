# Truck-Scheduler

This code has been developed to schedule Long Haul trucks of a leading pharmaceutical distritbution comapny. This code alont with a fully integrated UI went to production early 2016 and it is scheduling all the weekly trucks (140+ routes) and 7 days of the week.
Optimization constraints and parameters are explained in details within the body of the .mod model. The production code is slightly different as it is interacting with the UI.

I have recieved my former employers approval to share the source code since its development in 2016.
